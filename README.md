# VBA-Stock-Market-Analysis

This repository demonstrates the use of VBA to instantly analyze several million data points of stock price data. The raw data was summarized in a secondary output table with yearly change, percent change, and total volume for each stock. A subsequent table was then generated with tertiary analysis. This code was looped through each sheet (corresponding to each calendar year of stock data) in the workbook.
